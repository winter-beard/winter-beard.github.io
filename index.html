				<p>Though the 99.9% effectiveness of IUDs is well known by those who have them, you rarely internalize those odds in terms of the .1% representing real people's stories. </p>
					
				<p>In February 2021 I took three pregnancy tests convinced even after every subsequent positive test, the next would be negative because of my IUD. </p>
					
				<p>Following Roe vs Wade's reversal it is harder for women who face an unplanned pregnancy to own their choices, and more unaffordable as the process becomes more monetarily and time intensive, especially in more conservative states. I wanted to see just how many women in the US will be in the situation I was in. </p>
				<p>To do this I turned to the CDC's National Survey of Family Growth. It is the largest survey of contraceptive choice, and unplanned pregnancies. I compared IUD uptake to the clinical trial data on failure rates of several different brands, showing a slight decline in effectiveness over time.   </p>

Female sterilization, male sterilization and IUDs give you the best odds of not falling pregnant unexpectedly when you are sexually active, while unprotected sex has an 85% failure rate and withdrawal 20%. The most popular birth control method is female sterilization (more than 13 million women) followed by the pill (10 million). Far fewer women are using IUDs and their partner's vasectomy to prevent pregnancy despite them being many times more effective than condoms or the pill." /></noscript></div>

						<p>Across the whole population of women 15-49 years old in the US, unplanned pregnancies account for over 3.6 million pregnancies every year - and just under 2 million of these are people who were trying to prevent a pregnancy. Far fewer women are using IUDs and their partner's vasectomy to prevent pregnancy despite them being many times more effective than condoms or the pill.</p>

						<p>My analysis here came from extrapolating the contraceptive habits and patterns of the 6,141 women surveyed in the CDC's National Survey of Family Growth multiplied by each method's failure rate. This cumulatively finds that 5% of the female population between the ages of 15 and 49 years old experience an unplanned pregnancy. A 2012 report by the Brookings Institute found the lion-share of abortion demand, about 90 percent was due to unintended pregnancy. Extrapolating the amount of unplanned pregnancies at the state-level as a gauge of demand for abortion and then determining on a per-aborotion-clinic basis, clearly shows even many states where abortion is legal are ill-suited to offer women local and timely access to abortion if they need it. This analysis worryingly shows that many states are overwhelmed by their own populations, and would be even more overwhelmed with the influx of out-of-state demand. It is even worse still how many of the most-overwhelmed states are those that border the black-hole of abortion access that is the Southern United States.</p>

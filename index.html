				<p>Though the 99.9% effectiveness of IUDs is well known by those who have them, you rarely internalize those odds in terms of the .1% representing real people's stories. </p>
					
				<p>In February 2021 I took three pregnancy tests convinced even after every subsequent positive test, the next would be negative because of my IUD. </p>
					
				<p>I wanted to see just how many women in the US will be in the situation I was in, and what the situation today looked like in terms of their access to abortion.</p>
				<p>To do this I turned to the CDC's National Survey of Family Growth. It is the largest survey of contraceptive choice, and unplanned pregnancies. Across the population and across 1000 users of different birth control method I wanted to see how many cases of unplanned pregnancy there would be. I compared IUD uptake to the clinical trial data on failure rates of several different brands, showing a slight decline in effectiveness over time. I also used updated the the ANSIRH Abortion Facility Database with the recent reporting by the NYTimes on abortion services clinics closure or cessation of services in the last year. This dataset allowed me to see which states would be under the most pressure given the number of unplanned pregnancies could be expected in each state.   </p>

The most popular birth control method is female sterilization (more than 13 million women) followed by the pill (10 million). Far fewer women are using IUDs and their partner's vasectomy to prevent pregnancy despite them being many times more effective than condoms or the pill." /></noscript></div></div>

						<p>Across the whole population of women 15-49 years old in the US, unplanned pregnancies account for over 3.6 million pregnancies every year - and just under 2 million of these are people who were trying to prevent a pregnancy. Far fewer women are using IUDs and their partner's vasectomy to prevent pregnancy despite them being many times more effective than condoms or the pill.</p>

						<p> A 2012 report by the Brookings Institute found the lion-share of abortion demand, about 90 percent was due to unintended pregnancy. Extrapolating the amount of unplanned pregnancies at the state-level as a gauge of demand for abortion and then determining on a per-aborotion-clinic basis, clearly shows even many states where abortion is legal are ill-suited to offer women local and timely access to abortion if they need it. This analysis worryingly shows that many states are overwhelmed by their own populations, and would be even more overwhelmed with the influx of out-of-state demand. It is even worse still how many of the most-overwhelmed states are those that border the black-hole of abortion access that is the Southern United States.</p>

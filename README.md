IUD Pregnancies
Project 1 for Columbia University Lede Program

Aim: To visualize the amount of females in the United States who become pregnant every year due especially to IUD failure and more widely from birth control method failure.

Findings - there are around 200,000 women who become pregnant every year despite their IUD, given IUD uptake and failure rates. Though the 99% effectiveness of IUDs is well known by those who have them, you rarely internalize those odds in terms of the 1% representing real people's stories. I thought visualizing this in terms of the individuals who will have an unintended failure due to method failure would be a new perspective. It is one I have adopted after becoming pregnant this way. In the United States this will mean over a three year period (the length of most IUD's effectiveness at the time of the survey - the FDA's extension of the Mirena will make for an interesting update in outcomes) more than half a million women between 15 and 49 in the US with an IUD will become pregnant.

So not to scare people from the most effective form of birth control I wanted to compare this with birth control pills' effectiveness and condoms' effectiveness, and no birth control.

Data Collection: Data at present largely stems from the 2017-2019 National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG) which is undertaken by the CDC. This data was removed from its web-based interactive CodeBook and instead accessible as a pdf. I used two of the survey's three codebooks, one focussed on pregnancies and one on female contraception. I took the tables and created my own CSV file. This is the most recent published data - but I am excited for the next iteration's publication given the exciting data it contains and massively large sample size for research of this nature.

Overviews of analysis:

I was most initially interested in the Pregnancy codebook variable tables titled: WHATMETH(01-05)- what method of birth control people were on in the months prior to pregnancy; WHYPRG - which showed among those with unwanted/unintended pregnancies, who answered improper bc use, bc failure or no bc was behind pregnancy; and whynopg1 variables - detailing why the respondent was not on bc. What confused me the most was how I could untangle statistics from recent pregnancies from pregancies that occured decades ago, when IUDs were a totally different beast (the earliest pregnancy captured by the data occurred in 1967). On one hand you have the 127 respondents who said their birth control method failed and had unwanted/unintended pregnancies (WHYPRG) but unfortunately that doesn’t detail which birth control method and on the other you have all the reported pregnancies regardless of wantedness with WHATMETH(01-05) that has better detail on what method failed, however that encompassed many historic pregnancies so IUD failure rate appeared to be .3% far lower than it actually is because it was a historically uncommon method due to safety concerns.

Point of confusion/hair-pulling: Whynopg1 a facet of WHYPRG (asking those who answered they weren't on birth control when they became pregnant with an unwanted pregnancy, why they weren't on birth control) noted 9 people who earlier said they weren’t using a birth control said they thought they couldn’t get pregnant because they were on birth control “Method failure” (x_x) Not sure if I should have added those 9 to the WHYPRG total or if they would have already answered their birth control failure in the 127 figure of WHYPRG. I initially chose to assume the latter.

I believe the timing of the pregnancy so to focus on the WHATMETH variable for only pregnancies in one year between 2017-2019 is actually available in a more detailed Codebook so to find out I emailed Dr Kathy Kost - Head of Domestic reserach at the Guttmacher Institute, a non-profit dedicated to reproductive justice, who has published an analysis of pregnancy wantedness contained in the data and appeared to be able to do this.

In the mean time I decided to use the NSFG survey of 6141 women for their contraception decisions and not the 10215 survey of women on their pregnancies. Then assuming this was reflective of the entire population of 72.7 million females between the age 15 and 49 in the United States, how many would fall pregnant due to their IUD's failure (there is a slight descrepancy between copper and hormonal IUDs but the NSFG asked if people's IUDs were hormonal or copper.

Things I would have liked to try: Details on the location of pregnant women was unavailable for reason of privacy but I wished I could have accessed them to see how the varying controls on abortion that have come into force since the reversal of Roe vs Wade would mean for women's available choices about their pregnancy depending on their location. [Perhaps this is something I can FOIA in future]

New Skills: Reading the detailed descriptions of what each variable meant in terms of survey questions was really good practice. Then making sure the data made sense, deciding it did not and then realizing it was due to the inclusion of very historical pregancies also feels like it has made me more acutely skeptical.
